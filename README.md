# Python_Series  

 A practical Python learning series with **real-world case studies**.  
Instead of abstract examples, this repository teaches Python basics and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) through **hands-on mini projects**.  

---

##  Why This Repo?  
Many beginners struggle to jump directly from Python basics to complex competitive programming problems.  
This repo fills the gap by:  
- Explaining concepts with **real-life scenarios** (e.g., supermarkets, retail, airlines).  
- Giving **hands-on coding practice** for each concept.  
- Building a **solid foundation** before tackling advanced DSA or contests.

## Prerequisites

  This repo is designed for learners who:
  Already know the basics of Python (syntax, loops, functions).
  Want hands-on practice with real-world case studies to strengthen fundamentals.
  Are preparing to move toward DSA and competitive programming.

## Getting Started  

1.Clone the repository:  

git clone https://github.com/Muthumaha-S/Python_Series.git.
cd Python_Series.

2. Install Python (if not already installed)
Check version:
python --version

3. Install Jupyter Notebook
 pip install notebook

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
From inside the repo folder, run:
  jupyter notebook
This will open a browser window.

5. Open a Notebook
  Click on 01_basics.ipynb to start with Python fundamentals.
  Then open 02_DSA.ipynb for Data Structures and Algorithms.

6. Run the Code
  Select a cell and press Shift + Enter to execute it.
  Work through each problem step by step.
  Modify the code and experiment for better hands-on learning.
